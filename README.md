I'm a tech enthusiast who used to work with private equity firms, helping them buy various tech products to enhance their portfolio.

After migrating to the U.S from Pakistan when I was 18 I went to the University of Michigan where I graduated in three years with a neuroscience degree before getting a masters in business. My journey has been exciting and full of adventures so far, and i'm excited to keep on learning and growing in a career in the tech industry.
